# My Django REST Template

This template was generated from a CMD using `Python` v "^3.9", it runs `Django` v "^4.0.4", `Sentry-sdk` v "^1.5.11", and `Djangorestframework` v "^3.13.1" libraries.

Feel free to clone repo and improve on it.

## Local Development
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (requirements.txt)
- Start the wsgi server by running `python -m manage runserver`
